## ABOUT ME

I am Dragos Nechifor, a meticulous and detail-oriented software tester, passionate about ensuring the quality and functionality of software products. With experience in manual testing methodologies and a fervent enthusiasm for automation testing, I am dedicated to carefully evaluating software applications to detect and remedy defects. I appreciate applications that run smoothly, without defects or delays, and provide a complete and enjoyable experience for both regular users and professionals from various fields. My goal is for each application to become a usual and indispensable tool for the user, whether it is an ordinary citizen or an employee of a company, and to remain an essential choice in their day-to-day activities.

I am committed not only to ensuring the quality and functionality of software products but also to contributing to the success of the business or improving the experience/personal life, as appropriate, by guaranteeing an unparalleled user experience. I understand that a quality application is vital for achieving organizational goals or personal needs and I am committed to contributing to the process of achieving them through software testing.
