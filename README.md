## ABOUT ME

I am a meticulous and detail-oriented software tester, passionate about ensuring the quality and functionality of software products. With experience in manual testing methodologies and a fervent enthusiasm for automation testing, I am dedicated to carefully evaluating software applications to detect and remedy defects. Everybody values applications that run smoothly, without defects or delays, which provide a complete and enjoyable experience for both regular users and professionals from various fields. My goal is for each application to become a usual and indispensable tool for the user, whether it is an ordinary citizen or an employee of a company, and to remain an essential choice in their day-to-day activities.

I am committed not only to ensuring the quality and functionality of software products but also to contributing to the business's success or improving the experience/personal life, as appropriate, by guaranteeing an unparalleled user experience. I understand that a quality application is vital for achieving organizational goals or personal needs and I am committed to contributing to the process of achieving them through software testing.

## Skills:

### Manual Testing:

I have gained experience and knowledge in manual testing of web applications, developing and executing test plans, identifying and reporting bugs, and ensuring a smooth and error-free user experience. <be>
This expertise helps me approach various testing scenarios and ensure that applications are functional and intuitive for users.

### Jira & Zephyr:

I've delved into project management and software testing using Jira and Zephyr, both through coursework and self-study.<br> 
I've learned how to plan, assign, and track projects by creating epics, stories, and tasks. Additionally, I've gained proficiency in generating various reports to monitor progress and performance. <br>
Moreover, I've created testing cycles, tests, and bug reports, which I've organized and managed using the Zephyr plugin. <br>
This expertise is reflected in the test plan project within my portfolio: [Test Plan Project](https://github.com/Dragosne/Portfolio/tree/main/TM-Projects/TEST%20PLAN%20PROJECT)

### API Testing: 

Through hands-on practice with tools like Postman, I've learned to organize requests into collections, leverage global or environmental variables, and write JavaScript scripts in both pre-request and post-request stages to automate tests and validate API responses. <br>
Additionally, I've utilized Newman to execute Postman collections automatically. <be>
Examples of applications used for study include learning platforms like GroceryStore or BookStore, as well as live applications such as Spotify or Trello. <br>
In this regard, the API-Postman project in my portfolio showcases this expertise: [API Postman Project](https://github.com/Dragosne/Portfolio/tree/main/TM-Projects/API%20Postman)

### MySQL

In the realm of MySQL, I've grasped fundamental concepts such as creating, populating, and deleting databases and tables. <br>
I've also honed my skills in data manipulation using various queries and subqueries, leveraging functions, filters, and keys. <be>
This knowledge is showcased in the MySQL project within my portfolio: [MySQL Project](https://github.com/Dragosne/Portfolio/tree/main/TM-Projects/MySQL%20Project)

### Automated Testing and Python Programming:

From the early courses, I've been captivated by the world of automated testing. Each project has been an opportunity for me to grow and learn new things in the field of testing and programming. <br>
I'm passionately dedicated to creating automated tests and motivated to continuously advance in this direction.<br>
I've gained solid knowledge in using Python for testing both front-end and back-end applications. I've created frameworks using both unittest and Behaviour Driven Development (BDD).<br>
I've performed tests on various live and learning applications, exploring and testing the behavior of different web interface elements using various selectors.<br>
Additionally, I've explored automated testing of APIs using the requests library and unittest to create a testing framework to verify and validate API responses.<br>

My projects reflect this passion and determination:
• [Unittest Project](https://github.com/Dragosne/Portfolio/tree/main/TA-Projects/automation_testing_unit_test_bebetei)
• [BDD Project](https://github.com/Dragosne/Portfolio/tree/main/TA-Projects/TA-BDD-project)
• [API Project](https://github.com/Dragosne/Portfolio/tree/main/TA-Projects/TA-API-Project)

I believe that the most important thing is how you approach a problem or a task in general in order to successfully complete it. If you can first look at the big picture and understand what you're dealing with, meaning where you're starting from and where you need to go, then half of the work is already done. The next step is to determine the path to follow in this process, to break down into smaller steps, to evaluate the problem, to establish the approach, to identify strengths and weaknesses, to find the optimal route to follow, and to assess the resources needed, the tools necessary for the desired outcome. In essence, if you can do all this, you can say that you've completed the other half as well. Overall, this way of working can help you both in your daily life on a personal level and in business, regardless of the profession you choose to pursue.
